# React-Gridmaker

We'll be working through the same user stories as Assignment 3, though we'll be developing our Gridmaker using React development strategies.
For each user story, create one (or more) feature branch(s), develop your changes, open a PR and merge your changes based on feedback.
Complete the following user stories:
As a user, I can click a button to add a row to the grid
As a user, I can click a button to add a column to the grid
As a user, I can click a button to remove a row from the grid
As a user, I can click a button to remove a column from the grid
As a user, I can select a color from a dropdown menu of colors
As a user, I can click any cell and change its color to the one selected in the dropdown menu
As a user, I can click a button to color all cells with the color selected in the dropdown menu
As a user, I can click a button to color all uncolored cells with the color selected in the dropdown menu
As a user, I can click a button to remove the color from all cells
Bonus stories - Up to 17% extra credit
(2%) As a user, I want my buttons to be well-styled, contained neatly within divs, and centered on the screen
(6%) As a user, I want to select a color from a color wheel, that will show the RGB or Hex value of the color I selected
(7%) As a user, I want to be able to toggle between two modes: (1) clicking a cell to change its color (default) and (2) clicking a cell to change its color and fill all contiguously similar cells, connected by up/down/left/right borders, similar to a fill/paintbucket effect.
(2%) As a user, I don't want my grid to expand endlessly off of the screen, either horizontally or vertically.
Hightly recommended: Complete the React Tutorial: Tic Tac Toe before starting this assignment. This will give you experience working with React concepts that will make this assignemtn much easier (Components, State, Parent/Child relationships, passing data through props, making compartmentalized squares that do something when clicked *hint*, maintaining the state of a grid of squares *hint* *hint*).
Also recommended: Start this assignement using the same tutorial starter code, attached here in a .zip file.
